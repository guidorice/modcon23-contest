# Spatial envelope optimization and benchmarks

A [Mojo](https://github.com/modularml/mojo)üî• project calculating the spatial envelope, and exploring the
performance of Python, NumPy, and Mojo.

## Envelope

Calculating an envelope is a fundamental part of spatial analysis. The envelope
(aka: bounds, bbox, mbr) is usually defined by an xmin, ymin, xmax, and ymax
representing the minimum and maximum x (longitude) and y (latitude) coordinates
that encompass the bounded feature(s).

## Variants benchmarked

- na√Øve Python
- na√Øve Mojo
- Python using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (well-optimized C code)
- Mojo optimized with vectorization and loop unrolling, single-threaded (mojo optimized "a")
- Mojo optimized with parallelization, vectorization and loop unrolling. (mojo optimized "b")

## All benchmarks

Test system: mojo `0.5.0` on Apple M2, 24GB RAM. Data type: `float32`.

## Key Findings

1. [Mojo optimized "a"](./mojo_impl/optimized_a.mojo) is the best overall
performer. However for large feature spaces (millions of points) we can get
at least an additional 25% speedup by using one thread per dimension, as shown in
[Mojo optimized "b"](./mojo_impl/optimized_b.mojo).

2. Even more performance optimizations are possibly left on the table, such as
auto-tuning, stack allocation, and tiled/striped memory access. A fusion of
Mojo optimized "a" and "b" could offer the best performance across all feature
sizes.

3. In addition to being performance winners, the Mojo variants are
parameterized by the number of dimensions (`dims`) and by data type (`dtype`).
In other words, the same generic code can run, for example, `float16`,
`float64` or with 3, 4 or more dimensions. In GIS systems the number of
dimensions is sometimes referred to as XY, XYZ, or XYZM, where Z is "height",
and M is "measure".
