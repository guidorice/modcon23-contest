# Spatial envelope optimization and benchmarks

A [Mojo](https://github.com/modularml/mojo)ðŸ”¥ project calculating the spatial envelope, and exploring the
performance of Python, NumPy, and Mojo.

## Envelope

Calculating an envelope is a fundamental part of spatial analysis. The envelope
(aka: bounds, bbox, mbr) is usually defined by an xmin, ymin, xmax, and ymax
representing the minimum and maximum x (longitude) and y (latitude) coordinates
that encompass the bounded feature(s).

## Variants benchmarked

- naÃ¯ve Python
- naÃ¯ve Mojo
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) optimized Python
- Mojo optimized with vectorization and loop unrolling, single-threaded (mojo optimized "a")
- Mojo optimized with parallelization, vectorization and loop unrolling. (mojo optimized "b")

## All benchmarks

Test system: mojo `0.5.0` on Apple M2, 24GB RAM. Data type: `float32`.

## Key Findings

1. [Mojo optimized "a"](./mojo_impl/optimized_a.mojo) is the best overall
performer. However for large feature spaces (millions of points) we can get
at least an additional 25% speedup by using one thread per dimension, as shown in
[Mojo optimized "b"](./mojo_impl/optimized_b.mojo).

2. Even more performance optimizations are possibly left on the table, such as
autotuning, and tiled/striped memory access.

3. In addition to being performance winners, the Mojo versions are parameterized by
the number of dimensions (`dims`) and by data type (`dtype`). In other words,
the same generic code can run, for example, `float16`, `float64` or with 3,
4 or more dimensions. In GIS systems this is often referred to as XY, XYZ, or
XYZM, where Z is "height", and M is "measure".
